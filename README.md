# Ford GOBike System Data: Exploratory-and-Explanatory-Visualization
This  project captures mainly various plots used to explore a dataset and subsequently polishing these plots to  make them more self explanatory to end users.

## Dataset
The data consists of information on 183411 trips across the San Francesco Bay by bikers in the month of February 2019. The information in the dataset insclude, start and end times, gender of biker, birth year of biker, start and end coordinates, start and end station IDs, bike ID, duration of trips and whether or not a trip utilized bike-share through out or not.

A bit of data wrangling (including feature engineering) was done to render the dataset useable for generating insights via visualizations. Features added include age of bikers, start and end hour, period of day, day of week and distance covered in kilometers.

## Key Insights for Presentation
For my presentation, A slide was generated from jupyter notebook which focused on the gender and duration distribution, the relation between bikers age and their duration of trip and finally the relation between the period of day, bikers age and the durations of trips.
