# Ford GOBike System Data: Exploratory-and-Explanatory-Visualization
This  project captures mainly various plots used to explore a dataset and subsequently polishing these plots to  make them more self explanatory to end users.

## Dataset
The data consists of information on 183411 trips across the San Francesco Bay by bikers in the month of February 2019. The information in the dataset insclude, start and endtimes, gender of biker, birth year of biker, start and end coordinates, start and end station IDsbike ID, duration of trips and whether or not a trip utilized bike-share through out or not. Visit here for the dataset.

A bit of data wrangling (including feature engineering) was done to render the dataset useable for generating insights via visualizations. Feature added include age of bikers, start and end hour, period of day, day of week and distance covered in kilometers.

## Key Insights for Presentation
For my presentation, I focused on the gender and duration distribution. I also looked at the relation between bikers age and their duration of trip and finally the relation betwen the period of day, bikers age and the durationsof trips.

First, males made up 74.6 % of the total number of bikers followed by females with 23.4 % and the remainder being bikers who did not declared their gender. Seondly, majority of bikers completed their trips in 2000 seconds or less. i.e. approxiamate 33 mins or less and that there is medium to strong correlation between bikers 50 years and less who complete their trips approximately 17 minutes or less but barely no correlation between age and durations for the other bikers completing their trips beyond approximately 17 mins. Finally, I found that most trip distance is covered between morning and evening and bikers above 65 years avoid starting their trips in the late evening, dawn and midnight periods of the day.
